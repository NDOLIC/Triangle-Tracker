    <ul>
        <li>How you can know if tree sides you have make a Triangle </li>
    <p>The sum of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the length of the third side</p> 
    <p>If you take the three sides of a triangle and add them in pairs, the sum is greater than (not equal to) the third side</p> 
    <p>If that is not true, then it is not possible to construct a triangle with the given sides.</p>
