    <h1>Triangle-Tricker</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>How you can know if tree sides you have make a Triangle </li>
           <p>The sum of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the length of the third side</p> 
            <p>If you take the three sides of a triangle and add them in pairs, the sum is greater than (not equal to) the third side</p> 
            <p>If that is not true, then it is not possible to construct a triangle with the given sides.</p>
        <li>Equilateral triangle</li>
            <p>The Equilateral triangle has three congruent sides and three congruent angles</p>
            <p>Each side must have 60 degree</p>
        <li>Isosceles triangle</li>
            <p> The Isosceles triangle has two equal sides and two equal angles</p> 
        <li>Scalene Triangle</li>
            <p>The Scalene Triangle has no congruent sides</p>
            </ul> 
            <p>According  to the above conditions let try to enter those sides and see which type of a triangle we have</p>
